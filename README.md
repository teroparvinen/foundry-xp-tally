# XP Tally for the Foundry Virtual Tabletop

For the dnd5e system.

Keep track of all the experience gathered during a game, divide it up among the players and add to the character sheet.

The module automatically picks up opponents defeated in combat. Entries can be manually added by dragging actors onto the XP tracker and freeform milestone awards can be manually entered.

After awarding the XP to the player characters, the entries are transferred to a browsable history, where you can access all the previous rewards.

### Other features

- Optionally make adjustments by character when distributing XP
- Select whether to have the players collect XP from a chat card or to automatically apply XP to the characters
